# random_names.py
This is a small project targeting to create a (sort of) easy to pronounce words.

This Project was inspired by the following Video:

## Commands
All commands are executed relative the root directory of the project.
Without any arguments, using `./random_names.py` it will generate only one random name.

You can supply the argument --times, or the shorthand -t to generate multiple names.
For example: `./random_names.py --times 25`

If you'd like to export the names into a file, pretty much any Unix and Linux systems support writing STDOUT to a files, usage is like following:
`./random_names --times 10 >> file.ext`
## License
None!
